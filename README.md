# Fentanyl Data Model LLM

## Problem
All data is super messy, largely driven by excel spreadsheets. Prone to human error, manually intensive in manipulating the data to extract critical insight.

## Objective
To organize the data through formalized data models and load that data into some system that will enable future users to engage the data. Institutionalize the data.

Task is highly experimental and exploratory.

### Recommended paths
- Use some LLM to help generate potential data models
- Use prompt engineering to develop data models for the four structures.

### Four potential data models for the data:
- Relational
- Graph
- GeoSpatial
- Multimedia

## End Result
Relational Database in a 3rd normal form(?)
